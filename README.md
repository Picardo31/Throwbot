# Throwbot
This project aims to propose a scale mobile robot commonly called ”Throwbot”. The purpose of this mobile robot is to allow the operator to remotely obtain video for area reconnaissance indoors. The project is proposed as an idea for a security application to recognize, verify and/or analyze the environment and its possible alterations or
personnel incursions. In this way, its application establishes a direct relationship with its use for organizations or security institutions such as police or military usage with the concept of “urban combat” or “surveillance team”.
